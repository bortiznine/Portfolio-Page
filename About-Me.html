<p>Starting Story:

    I grew up in Chicago and for that reason the exposure to electronic music was everywhere. I first heard house when I had a friend with a boombox playing old freestyle music.
    <br>
    Fast forward to today.I have experienced going to raves, parties, DJ trails line ups and more. It opened the chance for me to get into other subgenres of electronic music.
